Languages file
==============
The 'languages' file contains a list of active languages (alphabets) which is used for a text classification.

Each line contains "language_name" token which is a full language name like "english" 
and should match the file "language_name.lm".

Optionally, the unicode ranges that include all characters for the language may be declared after language_name.

.lm files
=========

The "language_name.lm" files contain language models - n-grams for a classification algortithm.
File format is similar to TextCat but it uses unicode characters.

Each line contains the n-gram and (optionally, not used in algorithm) the frequency of this
n-gram in source text which was used to generate this file.

Lines ordered from the most frequent n-gram to the least frequent. 
The "_" character means space character.
